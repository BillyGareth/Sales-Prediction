# Grocery Sales Forecasting

Product sales forecasting is a major aspect of purchasing management. Forecasts are crucial in
determining inventory stock levels, and accurately estimating future demand for goods has been an
ongoing challenge, especially in the Supermarkets and Grocery Stores industry. If goods are not readily
available or goods availability is more than demand overall profit can be compromised. As a result, sales
forecasting for goods can be significant to ensure loss is minimized. Additionally, the problem becomes
more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever transitioning
seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing. In this analysis, a forecasting model is developed
using machine learning algorithms to improve the accurately forecasts product sales. The proposed
model is especially targeted to support the future purchase and more accurate forecasts product sales
and is not intended to change current subjective forecasting methods. A model based on a real grocery
store's data is developed in order to validate the use of the various machine learning algorithms. In the
case study, multiple regression methods are compared. The methods impact on forecast product
availability in store to ensure they have just enough products at right time.
